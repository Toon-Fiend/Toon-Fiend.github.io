		<h1>You have taken the right path.</h1>

		<p><h1>You came across bodies, this was a bad idea</h1></p>

		<p><h1>Along the way you have faced death trap to death trap, really pissed off skeletons, armored zombies and rabid dogs. You tired to use you moral support item on the dogs but it didn't work. Maybe the dogs were already used to the trick from the previous adventurer's that entered the dungeon. Darn.<p></p>

		<p><h1>You somehow managed to get pass the dog. You catched your breath and looked around.</h1></p>

		<p><h1>You tried to go back to the path you came from but noticed the way you came from is blocked.</h1></p>

		<p><h1>Oh crap baskets x2</h1></p>

		<p><h1>You sit down on the rocky floor and reflect on how you got to this postition. How yeah, to find a hot dog.</h1></p>

		<h1>You are a gremlin, a being of unknown origin, a creature shrouded in mystery, and very short. You're right at the footsteps of the infamous dungeon that has taken many lives of adventurer's before you.</h1>

		<p><h1>You have one goal, to find a hotdog in the dungeon. You recently had a craving for hotdogs and the local hotdog store is closed for the time being due to an "accident" that may or may not involve you. You didn't feel like making a hotdog at home nor felt like waiting for the store to open. So the best next thing is to raid a dungeon that has killed people for the silver of the chance for there to be a hotdog. Very logical.</h1></p>

		<p><h1>Before heading into certain doom, you have to bring only one of the following items: a Snack or a big stick. You're not really sure why you brought snacks if you're planning on finding a hotdog but whatever. On the way to the dungeon you found a large stick and thought it looked cool so you decided to bring it with you. These items are mostly just for moral support in your quest for the fabled hotdog.</h1></p>
